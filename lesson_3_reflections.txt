When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I want to share it with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I may not want the changes in my local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks - clone within GitHun
	clones - copying repository within GitHun or locally
	branches - a new version of previous version of code that is apart from the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If I'm offline, I can still work on the latest copy of code from the time I pulled it from the respository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	We would have to use a file sharing system.  It would definitely be harder because ti would be hard to keep track of the changes.
