So far, I learned how to use diff to see what was deleted and added between two files.  This is a lot easier than going line by line between two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can go back to previous versions without having to redo my code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	pro - I am doumenting meaningful changes to my code
	con - I may forget to change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	
	Git assumes that your project involves multiple files while others assumes that one document is independent of the other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log shows all the changes made to the files
	git diff shows the difference between different versions of the same file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	I want to use it to keep track of my changes to my code
